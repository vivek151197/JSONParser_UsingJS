# JSONParser_UsingJS
Created parsers for null, boolean, number, string, space, array, object and sent all of them into value parser to give a definite value if,
any of the parsers take in the input relevant to them. 
Finally this value parser is called into JSON parser function after checking if the given input is a valid JSON and get an output with parsed JSON.
